# latex2mathml
Student project for compilers theory

Running (after compilation of project):
* ./executableFile firstTexFileName firstOutputRootName [secondTexFileName ...]

Where:
* executableFile - this project file after compilation 
* TexFileName - name of ```.tex``` file from which you want to translate LaTeX to MathML
* OutputRootName - root name of output file i.e. when you have two math environment places in your tex file and you specify this argument as ```output``` then this application will produce ```output1.xml``` and ```output2.xml```
